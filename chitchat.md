y: Should I go with TDD/DDD or melos for this project? It is been year+ I've used melos.
z: what are the features or project you are trying to build?
y: A portfolio where I will contain basic portfolio stuff like about, certification, work history so on..
n: It might be over engineering for melos.
y: yea, quite right ðŸ˜…
z: but might be good for practicing it again.
y: I am also thinking this way.

z: But you have to write lots of boilerplate code just for simple case.
z: How would you like to separate feature like certification, work? Does each one will be separated package on melos?
y: I am planning to do so.
n: each one will be feature, too much boilerplate ðŸ¤£
y: ðŸ˜…
z: ðŸ˜‚, It will contain duplicate code too.
y: hum
z: if you are planing to play again, not a bad idea though.
n: man
y: hum, gonna do it with melos, A solder must always clean gun ðŸ˜‚
