### what works

- `flutter_timezone: ^4.1.1` properly gives us the available timezone and local timezone

### what doesn't work

- timemachine, timemachine2 and timezone are to initialize for me

### What all I need to figure out

- get the timeOffset dataset so that I can parse from one timezone to another
