y: Should I go with TDD/DDD or melos for this project? It is been year+ I've used melos.
z: what are the features or project you are trying to build?
y: A portfolio where I will contain basic portfolio stuff like about, certification, work history so on..
n: It might be over engineering for melos.
y: yea, quite right 😅
z: but might be good for practicing it again.
y: I am also thinking this way.

z: But you have to write lots of boilerplate code just for simple case.
z: How would you like to separate feature like certification, work? Does each one will be separated package on melos?
y: I am planning to do so.
n: each one will be feature, too much boilerplate 🤣
y: 😅
z: 😂, It will contain duplicate code too.
y: hum
z: if you are planing to play again, not a bad idea though.
n: man
y: hum, gonna do it with melos, A solder must always clean gun 😂
x: Why you are taking such a pain, when you can put everything on single flutter project.
y: yea, ig I want to show in different way
x: does it worth the time? end of the, you will improve in certain way where last one will be the better one. is not it?
y: I can not deny this. but If I like to have N style I can always tweak in the package
x: what is the purpose of the history of N tweaks?
y: nothing Ig, just different flavor of app, yea; could just change the entry point
x: -\_-, why complicated then
y: just to practice mono-repo 😐
x: yea you've no life, don;t know how sort out and prioritize things; improve can be done later, make it Work first
