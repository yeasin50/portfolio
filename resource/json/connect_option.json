Recents are under NDA, I will be happy if yours is not, but good ones are often lies here. I often work as a part-time developer (20h/W) and take on additional contractual projects that require a few hours of maintenance each week. The rest of the time, I enjoy learning new things and contributing on different platforms. I also enjoy bug hunting and refactoring Flutter projects.  You will find me efficient in Flutter application development. I prioritize working on ethical projects that align with my values and avoid anything that conflicts with my principles.",
